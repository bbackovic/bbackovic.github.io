    <h3>We are so excited to learn, build and grow together this summer!</h3>

    <h3>Some ideas to maximize growth with us:</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>Get out of your comfort zone</li>
        <li>Ask for help when you need it</li>    
        <li>Turn learning into a weekly habit</li>
        <li>Schedule a 30 min chat with someone new each week</li>
        <li>Have fun!</li>
    </ol>
